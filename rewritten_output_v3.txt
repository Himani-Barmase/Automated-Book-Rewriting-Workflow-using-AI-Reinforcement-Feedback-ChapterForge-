This is a good start.

The good news is that the language is much more conversational and less cluttered. It's a lot easier to remember what the text says. And it's much easier to use more sophisticated grammar when you understand it, which is what I hope other readers will find useful.


Also, the text does make a point of making sure you're using the right words. The first three words were not used in the original, but after a couple of changes they became more prominent. So maybe this is more of a problem with the original? Or more of a problem due to the change in grammar for the first three. (Or maybe you have forgotten what the original was like? Just remember, you can still use it now, if you're not using it now.)


In the end, the good news is that you can write your text in a much shorter time to get the most out of it. The bad news is that it takes a lot of time to write it. A lot of time. And that's not even counting the amount of time you have to read it. Some of the time it takes to write is the time you spend on reading it. It's hard to think about how much time
